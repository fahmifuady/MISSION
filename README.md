# MISSION (Music by Expression)

Humans sometimes have difficulty choosing music or songs and playlists that suit their mood. People who are sad definitely want to listen to music that tends to be mellow and have a low beat, while people who are happy want to listen to songs that are filled with enthusiastic energy.

MISSION is a machine learning model that can detect human expressions, whether the detected user is sad, happy or neutral, then the system will provide the right song or playlist. This solution is designed to produce output in the form of a type of user expression by recognizing expressions from the camera and providing appropriate music recommendations based on the expressions read.
